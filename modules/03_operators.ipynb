    "### Lesson Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the two initial formulations of quantum mechanics (QM) was concerned with solving the time-independent wave equation (TIWE), which for a single particle of mass $m$ subject to an external potential $V(x,y,z)$ is given by\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\hbar}{2m}\\nabla^2\\Psi(x,y,z) + V(x,y,z)\\cdot\\Psi(x,y,z) = E\\cdot\\Psi(x,y,z)$$\n",
    "for the _wavefunction_ $\\Psi(x,y,z)$, which describes the particle's ``amplitude'' in three dimensional space and encodes all knowable information about the particle and its properties. The second-order partial differential equation above was immediately successful for describing the properties of simple 1-dimensional systems (e.g., the atomic structure of the Hydrogen atom), however it was soon generalized to a more fundamental formulation in terms of Hermitian operators and the Hilbert spaces spanned by their eigenstates. While this formulation provides deep physical insight into the properties of quantum mechanical systems under consideration and indeed quantum mechanics itself, working with operators can be a significant conceptual leap for students in an undergraduate course in physical chemistry. \n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this lesson is therefore to help students apply the SymPy symbolic mathematics engine and its `algebra_with_sympy` interface to define and explore the properties of operators, as well as to apply them within the context of quantum mechanical model systems akin to those encountered in an undergraduate course in physical chemistry."

Though famous, this particular uncertainty relationship is not special; in fact, many such uncertainty relationships exist between classical observables of quantum mechanical systems. Most notable about these uncertainty relationships is the fact that _they are inherent to the formulation of quantum mechanics itself_, rather than resulting from inaccuracies in measurement or poorly performed experiments. So what about quantum mechanics gives rise to uncertainty relationships?"
